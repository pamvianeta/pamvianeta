### About Me

I am a data analyst with experience driving measurable improvements in data accuracy, operational efficiency, and decision-making. I have worked across highly regulated sectors, including healthcare, manufacturing, and research, transforming data-driven processes and achieving results such as a 20% increase in data quality, a 35% reduction in operational defects, and a 15% decrease in rework costs.

I combine exploratory data analysis, storytelling, visualization, automation, Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Query, and Tableau to transform complex information into actionable insights for leaders and teams. My strength lies in data analytics and research methodology design, through dashboards, structured analysis, and business intelligence solutions that optimise performance. I aim to continue adding value by enabling organizations to make smarter, more efficient, and metrics-driven decisions.
